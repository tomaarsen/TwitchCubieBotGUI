# TwitchCubieBotGUI
Twitch Bot focusing on aggregating votes and averages from Twitch chat, with a GUI

---
# Explanation
When the bot has started, it will start listening to chat messages in the channel listed in the settings.txt file. All messages will be parsed, and votes and numbers will be stored for some amount of seconds after the messages comes in. For how long a message is stored after it comes in, and can be used for a vote, can be edited in the [Settings](https://github.com/CubieDev/TwitchCubieBotGUI#Settings) section.
If at some point someone decides to calculate a vote or average, this stored information will be used. <b>This means it is not needed to start a vote or average in advance</b> Note that if one user sends multiple votes or multiple values, newer values will override the older ones, so everyone only has one vote.

This is an extention of my existing [TwitchCubieBot](https://github.com/CubieDev/TwitchCubieBot) program, but now with a convenient and simple GUI:

An explanation of this GUI will be provided below the explanation of the bot itself.

| **Parameter**        | **Meaning** | **Example** |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Host                 | The URL that will be used. Do not change.                         | "irc.chat.twitch.tv" |
| Port                 | The Port that will be used. Do not change.                        | 6667 |
| Channel              | The Channel that will be connected to.                            | "#CubieDev" |
| Nickname             | The Username of the bot account.                                  | "CubieB0T" |
| Authentication       | The OAuth token for the bot account.                              | "oauth:pivogip8ybletucqdz4pkhag6itbax" |

Everything below this point is linked to the Settings page of the GUI, explained below.

I got my real OAuth token from https://twitchapps.com/tmi/.

# GUI
Some of the values from the settings.txt file can also be edited in the GUI. 
For reference, this is the GUI:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37621491/59962273-5ec58200-94e3-11e9-9d85-3cb54c15f6f1.png)

Let's clarify the functionality from the GUI:

| **Button** | **Action** |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Auth | This button will hide or unhide your Authentication token. This way you can hide it when you aren't changing it, so that it will not leak. |
| Stop | This button is both "Stop" and "Run" at the same time. When the bot is running, the button will say Stop. While it is not, it will display "Run". Pressing this button will either stop the bot from running, or start the bot using the information filled in above. | 
| Clear | Clears the console below |
| Vote | Equivalent to typing `!vote` in chat. Calls a vote. |
| Settings | Opens up a popup message, as shown on the left side in the screenshot. |
| Save & Close | Closes the setting popup message, and saves the settings. |

Note that the settings in the popup message refer to what will be shown in the console in the main GUI. This is the meaning of each section:

| **Name** | **Meaning** |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Sub | If regular subscriptions should show up in the message box. |
| Sub Gift Bomb | If sub mystery gifts (a handful subscriptions gifted to several randomly picked users) should show up in the message box. |
| Sub Gift | If regular subscription gifts should show up in the message box. |
| Average Results | If the results from `!average min max` should show up in the message box. |
| Average Cmd Errors | If errors from incorrect usages of `!average` should show up in the message box. Eg: `No recent numbers found to take the average from` or `Max parameter should be larger than Min parameter`. |
| Vote Results | If the results from `!vote min max` or `!vote` should show up in the message box. |
| Votes | If individual votes should show up in the message box. Eg: `A` or `Y`. |
| Vote Cmd Errors | If errors from incorrect usages of `!vote min max` or `!vote` should show up in the message box. Eg: `No votes found.` or `Max parameter should be larger than Min parameter`. |
| Numbers | If individual numbers should show up in the message box. Eg: `23.0` or `12.4`. |

# Requirements
* [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Module requirements](requirements.txt)<br>
Install these modules using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Among these modules is my own [TwitchWebsocket](https://github.com/CubieDev/TwitchWebsocket) wrapper, which makes making a Twitch chat bot a lot easier.
This repository can be seen as an implementation using this wrapper.
